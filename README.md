This project is a Discord music bot designed to play music in voice channels on Discord servers. The bot is built using [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA) and [Lavaplayer](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/lavaplayer) libraries.
It is called "DiscordBot 2.0" because I had previously created a [bot in Python](https://github.com/adam-przybylski/discord-music-bot).

Features:
- Music Playback: The bot can play music from various sources, such as YouTube, SoundCloud, or local files.
- Control Commands: Users can control playback with commands like play, pause, resume, skip, stop, and volume control.
- Queue Management: Users can add songs to the queue, view the queue, and remove songs from the queue.
- Playlist Support: The bot supports playing playlists from YouTube or other supported platforms.
- Searching: Users can search for specific songs or videos to play.

Requirements:
- JDK 17 or later.
